# Collaboration in Github

These are my notes after taking the following workshops:

DHRI workshop on Command Line: Session on the command line, a means of interacting with your computer programmatically through text.
(https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/command-line/)

DHRI workshop on Git: Session on Git, version control software for tracking project files, backing up data, and collaborating with others. Includes discussion of GitHub.(https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git)



To complete this workshop, you will need to have VS Code and Git installed on your local machine. If you have not installed them already, follow [this link to instructions for VS Code](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/vscode.md), and [this link to instructions for Git](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/master/sections/git.md).
